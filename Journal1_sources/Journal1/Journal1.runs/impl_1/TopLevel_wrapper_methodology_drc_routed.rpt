2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sysclk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): sysclk_IBUF_inst/O, TopLevel_i/sysclk
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin[7]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[0]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[1]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[2]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[3]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[4]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[5]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[6]/CLR, TopLevel_i/debounce_0/U0/count_bin_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
